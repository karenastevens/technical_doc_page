               Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
               simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
               together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development
               in many areas on most platforms.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all
                major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site
                also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
                The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

            <p>The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.10 on those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:</p>

            <code>python3.10</code>
            <p>to the shell. Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., /usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)</p>

            <p>On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, the python3.10 command will be available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use the py command. See Excursus: Setting environment variables for other ways to launch Python.</p>

            <p>Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: quit().</p>

            <p>The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support the GNU Readline library. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing Control-P to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if ^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.</p>

            <p>The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file.</p>

            <p>A second way of starting the interpreter is python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s) in command, analogous to the shell’s -c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote command in its entirety with single quotes.</p>

            <p>Some Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using python -m module [arg] ..., which executes the source file for module as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.</p>

            <p>When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. This can be done by passing -i before the script.</p>

            <p>By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.</p>

            <p>
                To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the first line of the file. The syntax is as follows:

                <code># -*- coding: encoding -*-</code>
                where encoding is one of the valid codecs supported by Python.

                For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file should be:

                <code># -*- coding: cp1252 -*-</code>
            </p>

            <p>
                One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX “shebang” line. In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:

                <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
                # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-</code>
            </p>

            <p>
                The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:

                
                <code>
                    >>> 2 + 2
                    4
                    >>> 50 - 5*6
                    20
                    >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
                    5.0
                    >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
                    1.6
                </code>
                The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.
            </p>

            <p>
                Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:

                
                <code>
                    >>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
                    5.666666666666667
                    >>>
                    >>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
                    5
                    >>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
                    2
                    >>> 5 * 3 + 2  # floored quotient * divisor + remainder
                    17
                </code>

                With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers 1:

                <code>
                    >>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared
                    25
                    >>> 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7
                    128
                </code>

                The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt:

                <code>
                    >>> width = 20
                    >>> height = 5 * 9
                    >>> width * height
                    900
                </code>

                If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:

                <code>
                    >>> n  # try to access an undefined variable
                    Traceback (most recent call last):
                        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
                    NameError: name 'n' is not defined
                </code>

                There is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type operands convert the integer operand to floating point:

                <code>
                     >>> 4 * 3.75 - 1
                        14.0
                </code>

                In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _. This means that when you are using Python as a desk calculator, it is somewhat easier to continue calculations, for example:

                <code>      
                    >>> tax = 12.5 / 100
                    >>> price = 100.50
                    >>> price * tax
                    12.5625
                    >>> price + _
                    113.0625
                    >>> round(_, 2)
                    113.06
                </code>

                </p>

                <p>This variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don’t explicitly assign a value to it — you would create an independent local variable with the same name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.
                </p>

                <p>In addition to int and float, Python supports other types of numbers, such as Decimal and Fraction. Python also has built-in support for complex numbers, and uses the j or J suffix to indicate the imaginary part (e.g. 3+5j).

            <p>
                Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to escape quotes:
            </p>

            <code>
                >>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
                'spam eggs'
                >>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
                "doesn't"
                >>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
                "doesn't"
                >>> '"Yes," they said.'
                '"Yes," they said.'
                >>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
                '"Yes," they said.'
                >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                '"Isn\'t," they said.'
            </code>

            <p>
                In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. While this might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print() function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:
            </p>

            <code>
                >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                >>> print('"Isn\'t," they said.')
                "Isn't," they said.
                >>> s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newline
                >>> s  # without print(), \n is included in the output
                'First line.\nSecond line.'
                >>> print(s)  # with print(), \n produces a new line
                First line.
                Second line.
            </code>

            <p>
                If you don’t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as special characters, you can use raw strings by adding an r before the first quote:
            </p>

            <code>
                >>> print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline!
                C:\some
                ame
                >>> print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote
                C:\some\name
            </code>

            <p>
                String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''. End of lines are automatically included in the string, but it’s possible to prevent this by adding a \ at the end of the line. The following example:
            </p>

            <code>
                print("""\
                Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
                -h                        Display this usage message
                -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
                """)
            </code>

            <p>produces the following output (note that the initial newline is not included):</p>

            <code>
                Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
                -h                        Display this usage message
                -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
            </code>

            <p>Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *:</p>

            <code>
                >>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
                >>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
                'unununium'
            </code>

            <p>
                Two or more string literals (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next to each other are automatically concatenated.

            </p>

            <code>
                >>> 'Py' 'thon'
                'Python'
            </code>

            <p>This feature is particularly useful when you want to break long strings:</p>

            <code>
                >>> text = ('Put several strings within parentheses '
                ...         'to have them joined together.')
                >>> text
                'Put several strings within parentheses to have them joined together.'
            </code>

            <p>
                Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.

                <code>
                    >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                    >>> squares
                    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                    Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:
                </code>

                <code>
                    >>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
                    1
                    >>> squares[-1]
                    25
                    >>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list
                    [9, 16, 25]
                </code>
               
                All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means that the following slice returns a shallow copy of the list:

                <code>
                    >>> squares[:]
                    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                </code>
               
                Lists also support operations like concatenation:

                <code>
                    >>> squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
                    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
                </code>
                
                Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content:

                <code>
                    >>> cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here
                    >>> 4 ** 3  # the cube of 4 is 64, not 65!
                    64
                    >>> cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value
                    >>> cubes
                    [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
                </code>
               
                You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using the append() method (we will see more about methods later):

                <code>
                    >>> cubes.append(216)  # add the cube of 6
                    >>> cubes.append(7 ** 3)  # and the cube of 7
                    >>> cubes
                    [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343]
                </code>
               
                Assignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size of the list or clear it entirely:

                <code>
                    >>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
                    >>> letters
                    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
                    >>> # replace some values
                    >>> letters[2:5] = ['C', 'D', 'E']
                    >>> letters
                    ['a', 'b', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'f', 'g']
                    >>> # now remove them
                    >>> letters[2:5] = []
                    >>> letters
                    ['a', 'b', 'f', 'g']
                    >>> # clear the list by replacing all the elements with an empty list
                    >>> letters[:] = []
                    >>> letters
                    []
                </code>
               
                The built-in function len() also applies to lists:

                <code>
                    >>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
                    >>> len(letters)
                    4
                </code>
                
                It is possible to nest lists (create lists containing other lists), for example:

                <code>
                    >>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
                    >>> n = [1, 2, 3]
                    >>> x = [a, n]
                    >>> x
                    [['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]]
                    >>> x[0]
                    ['a', 'b', 'c']
                    >>> x[0][1]
                    'b'
                </code>
